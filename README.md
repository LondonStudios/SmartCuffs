# London Studios - Update
Since forming London Studios in April 2020 we've created a number of **high quality** and **premium** resources for the FiveM project, focusing on the emergency services and aiming to bring your server to the next level.

Although we made a number of free resources such as this one in the first year, we've now switched to creating paid content, keeping them constantly updated and working along with providing the best possible support to our customers.

Our **most popular** resources now include *Smart Fires, Police Grappler* and *Smart Hose*.

With **thousands** of **happy customers** we are confident you'll love our resources and our active support team are on hand to help if you have any questions!

# Our store: https://store.londonstudios.net/github
# Our discord: https://discord.gg/nC2krpN

Therefore, this resource is now likely *out of date* and is *no longer supported by us*. The full source code is available should you wish to make any changes. All of our paid resources however are constantly updated and we invite you to take a look!

# SmartCuffs - London Studios
**SmartCuffs** is a **FiveM** resource coded in **C#** to enhance the player handcuff experience. You have the ability to both frontcuff and rearcuff other players, along with an included British Speedcuff Model and custom sounds.

The plugin gives you one pair of handcuffs, so ensure you get that back otherwise you will be unable to cuff other players until you retreive it, or another player hands you a pair.

The **British Speedcuffs** model will spawn on any ped, this is not EUP.

This plugin is made by **LondonStudios**, we have created a variety of releases including TaserFramework, SearchHandler, ActivateAlarm, SmartTester, SmartSounds, CustodyAlarm and more!

## Usage
**/cuff** - Rearcuff the nearest player.
**/frontcuff** - Frontcuff the nearest player.
**/resetcuff** - Gives you a pair of handcuffs again.

Both **/cuff** and **/frontcuff** have been mapped to Keybinds, these can be configured by each player, allowing for their own custom keybinds. These can be set in **Settings > Keybinds > FiveM.**
These **must** be setup by each player upon their first time using the plugin.

The included **British speedcuffs** sound will play upon cuffing and uncuffing, to all players in the area and reduce in volume based on distance from the cuff location.

You are not able to cuff players if you are in a vehicle, if you are already cuffed or you have no pairs remaining.
## Installation
 1.  Create a new **resource folder** on your server.
 2.  Add the contents of **"resource"** inside it. This includes:
"Client.net.dll", "Server.net.dll", "fxmanifest.lua", "html", "stream"
3. In **server.cfg**, "ensure" SmartCuffs, to make it load with your server startup.

## Source Code
Please find the source code in the **"src"** folder. Please ensure you follow the licence in **"LICENCE.md"**.

## Feedback
We appreciate feedback, bugs and suggestions related to SmartCuffs and future plugins. We hope you enjoy using the resource and look forward to hearing from people!

## Credits
The British Speedcuffs model has been made by a third party 3D modeller, known as "That Alien". We would like to thank them for allowing the release of the model and we hope to work with them in the future. This model may not be redistributed, modified or released. Model is released for use in conjunction with SmartCuffs.

 - Add /drag, allowing you to drag the nearest civilian
 - Add an option allowing you to place somebody in handcuffs into a vehicle
 - Add a config.ini file giving users more control over the plugin.
 - Fix any bugs which are discovered and reported.
